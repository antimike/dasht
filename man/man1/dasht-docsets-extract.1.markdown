## NAME

## SYNOPSIS

`dasht-docsets-extract` *FILE*...

### Examples

`dasht-docsets-extract` ../some\_path\_here/NET\_Framework.tgz
  Extracts the [Dash] docset archive file named "NET\_Framework.tgz" that is
  located in a subdirectory one level above the current working directory.

## DESCRIPTION

Extracts the given [Dash] docset archive *FILE*s (`*.tgz` files) into the
location specified by the `DASHT_DOCSETS_DIR` environment variable and then
renames their extracted directories to match their rootnames (sans `.tgz`).

If an extracted directory already exists, its contents are updated in place.

## ENVIRONMENT

`DASHT_DOCSETS_DIR`
  Defines the filesystem location where your [Dash] docsets are installed.
  If undefined, its value is assumed to be `$XDG_DATA_HOME/dasht/docsets/`
  or, if `XDG_DATA_HOME` is undefined, `$HOME/.local/share/dasht/docsets/`.

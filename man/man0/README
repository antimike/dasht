.TH Search API docs offline, in your terminal or browser
.PP
dasht is a collection of shell scripts for searching, browsing, and managing
API documentation (in the form of 200+ offline documentation sets \[la]https://kapeli.com/dash#docsets\[ra],
courtesy of Dash for macOS \[la]https://kapeli.com/dash\[ra]) all from the comfort of your own terminal!
.PP
The name "dasht" is a portmanteau of Dash \[la]https://kapeli.com/dash\[ra] and the letter "t", for terminal.
Etymologically, "dasht" is Persian for \fIplain\fP, as in an flat expanse of land,
which aptly characterizes the terminal environment where everything is text.

.SS Configuration
.PP
You may optionally configure the \fB\fCDASHT_DOCSETS_DIR\fR environment variable,
which defines the filesystem location where your Dash \[la]https://kapeli.com/dash\[ra] docsets are installed.
If undefined, its value is assumed to be \fB\fC$XDG_DATA_HOME/dasht/docsets/\fR or,
if \fB\fCXDG_DATA_HOME\fR is also undefined, \fB\fC$HOME/.local/share/dasht/docsets/\fR\&.
.PP
You may optionally configure the \fB\fCDASHT_CACHE_DIR\fR environment variable,
which defines the filesystem location where download links are cached.
If undefined, its value is assumed to be \fB\fC$XDG_CACHE_HOME/dasht/\fR
or, if \fB\fCXDG_CACHE_HOME\fR is also undefined, \fB\fC$HOME/.cache/dasht/\fR\&.
.SH Development
.PP
If you make changes to the embedded manual pages found in the comment headers
at the top of script files in the \fB\fCbin/\fR directory, then remember to run the
\fB\fCbinman\-rake\fR command afterward to regenerate UNIX manual pages for packaging.
